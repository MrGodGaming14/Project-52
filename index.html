<p><h4>
Hello, and welcome to Origami Designs, here we will tell you all about origami
and even might teach you a few designs too!
</h4></p>
<p><h4>
Origami, from ori meaning "folding", and kami meaning "paper" is the art of paper 
folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture. In modern usage, 
the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, 
regardless of their culture of origin. The goal is to transform a flat square 
sheet of paper into a finished sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques.  
Modern origami practitioners generally discourage the use of cuts, glue, or markings on the paper.
 Origami folders often use the Japanese word kirigami to refer to designs which use cuts.
